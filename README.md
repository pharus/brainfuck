# brainfuck

A lone game to explore brainfuck, going to implement an interpreter to study
the dynamics of the language, and then to the compiler.

Started by studying the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

### Interpreter:
- Version 0.0.1
	+ [x] Functional
	+ [x] Ignores invalid commands

### Compiler
Still TODO
