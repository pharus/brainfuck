A simple translator to C

#### bfc command

Observations:
- Fully functional
- Always generates a.c
- Uses 30kb array
- ignores invalid commands
- non optimized C code, so really big files

Done:
- Fully functional compliant as in the wiki
- Generates valid Ansi-C code

Todo:
- Optimization of C code
- Direct Machine translation in future
- Proper production code, instead of hacky one
