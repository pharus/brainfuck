# interpreter

A small and simple interpreter to start

#### brainfucki command

Considerations:
- Ignores invalid commands, so any text file is a valid program, even hidden
  one :)
- Each cell, as described in the wiki, is initialized to 0, and has 1 byte of
  size.
- Uses 30kb array as in the wiki doc.

Supports:
- Nested loops too(Case you're thinking of it)
